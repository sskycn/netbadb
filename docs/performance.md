# NetbaDB performance baseline

Phase 7A provides a transparent, dependency-free benchmark target for current
database and planner behavior. It measures; it does not optimize. The target
uses `std::time::Instant` and `std::hint::black_box`, and Cargo builds it with
the optimized bench profile.

Run the default quick profile for development confirmation:

```sh
cargo bench -p netbadb-core --bench phase7_baseline
```

Run the full profile for a manually recorded baseline:

```sh
NETBADB_BENCH_PROFILE=full \
  cargo bench -p netbadb-core --bench phase7_baseline
```

`NETBADB_BENCH_PROFILE` accepts only `quick` or `full` and defaults to
`quick`. Quick uses 250 small rows, 1,000 medium rows, and 100×100 plus 300×300
join inputs. Full uses 1,000 small rows, 10,000 medium rows, and 500×500 plus
1,000×1,000 joins. Profiles change only scale, warmup, and iteration counts;
schemas, distributions, SQL shapes, indexes, plan expectations, and result
semantics remain the same.

## Measurement semantics

This is a warm-process, current-buffer-pool baseline. Each read scenario first
executes unmeasured warmup iterations. It does not claim cold-disk behavior and
does not manipulate operating-system caches, call privileged APIs, or use
platform-specific cache controls.

Every scenario owns distinct temporary database files under
`std::env::temp_dir()`. Query setup creates the schema, deterministically loads
rows, registers indexes, and runs `ANALYZE` where required before starting an
`Instant`. Plan inspection, result verification, output, explicit database
close, and database/WAL cleanup are also outside the timed query loop. INSERT
is intentionally different: each sample starts with a newly created empty
database, and the timed operation includes the transaction begin, deterministic
row inserts, registered-index maintenance, and commit. Index creation itself
is setup and is not timed.

Each measurement retains a `Vec<Duration>`. Durations are sorted to report:

- minimum;
- median, using the middle value for an odd count and the integer mean of the
  two middle values for an even count;
- p95 using the nearest-rank rule, `ceil(0.95 × sample_count)`.

INSERT totals are divided by inserted rows and all output is shown as integer
nanoseconds per operation. No elapsed-time or throughput value is a test
assertion. Machine-specific numbers are deliberately not committed as expected
results, and the normal test suite does not execute the workload.

For a formal comparison, record at least the benchmark output, host CPU and
memory, operating system, storage environment, `rustc --version`, Git revision,
and profile. Compare runs on the same controlled machine. Phase 7 optimization
work must name the affected benchmark scenarios and retain their plan and
correctness checks; intuition alone is not a baseline.

## Deterministic data

Rows use their zero-based integer position as `id` and selective `bucket_id`.
`team_id` is a deterministic modulo distribution, `active` is true for every
third row, nullable scenarios use fixed modulo NULL rates, and payloads use a
fixed-width numeric suffix. There is no random generator, timestamp, hostname,
or repository-relative fixture path.

Every timed result is consumed through `black_box` and checked using an
expected row count plus deterministic numeric checksum. The benchmark also
calls `Database::inspect_statement` before timing and rejects a scenario whose
real chosen plan lacks its required operator or contains a forbidden access
path. It never infers an IndexScan merely because an index exists.

## Scenarios

The target currently covers:

- point equality with no index: `Filter → SeqScan`;
- the same point equality with an analyzed registered ID index:
  `Filter → IndexScan`;
- duplicate-heavy indexed equality where the costed planner chooses SeqScan;
- selective equality on a non-primary `bucket_id` index;
- low- and high-rate `IS NULL` distributions over a nullable index;
- one-percent and fifty-percent ranges over an indexed ID, both remaining
  SeqScan because range IndexScan is not implemented;
- `ORDER BY team_id LIMIT 20`, retaining explicit in-memory Sort and Limit;
- low- and higher-cardinality `GROUP BY team_id` through in-memory Aggregate;
- unique-like and duplicate-key NestedLoopJoin at two input scales;
- direct INSERT into tables with zero, one, and two registered indexes;
- SQL UPDATE of an indexed key while locating distinct rows through an index;
- `Database::inspect_statement` compile plus real physical-planning overhead.

The summary repeats the represented limitations: point equality/`IS NULL`
index access only, no range IndexScan, NestedLoopJoin only, explicit in-memory
Sort and Aggregate, and no join reorder. The benchmark does not rank future
work or emit optimization recommendations.

## CI and compatibility

`cargo check --workspace --all-targets` compiles the benchmark, including on
the Rust 1.85 MSRV. The expensive workload is not a normal CI performance gate
and has no pass/fail timing threshold.

Phase 7A changes no planner algorithm, inspection contract, NetbaDB Protocol
v1 message, SDK Schema Spec v1 field, deployment manifest v4 field, or database
persistent format.
