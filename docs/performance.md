# NetbaDB performance baseline

Phase 7A established a transparent, dependency-free benchmark target for
database and planner behavior. Phase 7B kept that target and used its measured
plan gap to optimize bounded integer ranges. After Phase 7B, join execution was
the highest read-path candidate: NestedLoopJoin materialized and copied a
combined row for every candidate pair before testing its predicate. Phase 7C
keeps the same benchmark target and removes that rejected-pair work. The target
uses `std::time::Instant` and `std::hint::black_box`, and Cargo builds it with
the optimized bench profile.

Run the default quick profile for development confirmation:

```sh
cargo bench -p netbadb-core --bench phase7_baseline
```

Run the full profile for a manually recorded baseline:

```sh
NETBADB_BENCH_PROFILE=full \
  cargo bench -p netbadb-core --bench phase7_baseline
```

`NETBADB_BENCH_PROFILE` accepts only `quick` or `full` and defaults to
`quick`. Quick uses 250 small rows, 1,000 medium rows, and 100×100 plus 300×300
join inputs. Full uses 1,000 small rows, 10,000 medium rows, and 500×500 plus
1,000×1,000 joins. Profiles change only scale, warmup, and iteration counts;
schemas, distributions, SQL shapes, indexes, plan expectations, and result
semantics remain the same.

## Measurement semantics

This is a warm-process, current-buffer-pool baseline. Each read scenario first
executes unmeasured warmup iterations. It does not claim cold-disk behavior and
does not manipulate operating-system caches, call privileged APIs, or use
platform-specific cache controls.

Every scenario owns distinct temporary database files under
`std::env::temp_dir()`. Query setup creates the schema, deterministically loads
rows, registers indexes, and runs `ANALYZE` where required before starting an
`Instant`. Plan inspection, result verification, output, explicit database
close, and database/WAL cleanup are also outside the timed query loop. INSERT
is intentionally different: each sample starts with a newly created empty
database, and the timed operation includes the transaction begin, deterministic
row inserts, registered-index maintenance, and commit. Index creation itself
is setup and is not timed.

Each measurement retains a `Vec<Duration>`. Durations are sorted to report:

- minimum;
- median, using the middle value for an odd count and the integer mean of the
  two middle values for an even count;
- p95 using the nearest-rank rule, `ceil(0.95 × sample_count)`.

INSERT totals are divided by inserted rows and all output is shown as integer
nanoseconds per operation. No elapsed-time or throughput value is a test
assertion. Machine-specific numbers are deliberately not committed as expected
results, and the normal test suite does not execute the workload.

For a formal comparison, record at least the benchmark output, host CPU and
memory, operating system, storage environment, `rustc --version`, Git revision,
and profile. Compare runs on the same controlled machine. Phase 7 optimization
work must name the affected benchmark scenarios and retain their plan and
correctness checks; intuition alone is not a baseline.

## Deterministic data

Rows use their zero-based integer position as `id` and selective `bucket_id`.
`team_id` is a deterministic modulo distribution, `active` is true for every
third row, nullable scenarios use fixed modulo NULL rates, and payloads use a
fixed-width numeric suffix. There is no random generator, timestamp, hostname,
or repository-relative fixture path.

Every timed result is consumed through `black_box` and checked using an
expected row count plus deterministic numeric checksum. The benchmark also
calls `Database::inspect_statement` before timing and rejects a scenario whose
real chosen plan lacks its required operator or contains a forbidden access
path. It never infers an IndexScan merely because an index exists.

## Scenarios

The target currently covers:

- point equality with no index: `Filter → SeqScan`;
- the same point equality with an analyzed registered ID index:
  `Filter → IndexScan`;
- duplicate-heavy indexed equality where the costed planner chooses SeqScan;
- selective equality on a non-primary `bucket_id` index;
- low- and high-rate `IS NULL` distributions over a nullable index;
- a one-percent bounded indexed-ID range selecting `RangeIndexScan`;
- a fifty-percent bounded indexed-ID range retaining `SeqScan` after cost
  comparison;
- a one-sided indexed-ID range retaining `SeqScan` because it is not costed;
- `ORDER BY team_id LIMIT 20`, retaining explicit in-memory Sort and Limit;
- low- and higher-cardinality `GROUP BY team_id` through in-memory Aggregate;
- unique-like, duplicate-key, and fully disjoint NestedLoopJoin at two input
  scales; disjoint left keys are `[0, N)` and right keys are `[N, 2N)` and must
  produce zero rows with checksum zero;
- direct INSERT into tables with zero, one, and two registered indexes;
- SQL UPDATE of an indexed key while locating distinct rows through an index;
- `Database::inspect_statement` compile plus real physical-planning overhead.

The Phase 7B estimator deliberately uses only existing table/index statistics
and the exact discrete key count implied by two Int64/UInt64 literal bounds.
Phase 7A showed that a narrow range paid full SeqScan cost even though point
lookup demonstrated an effective B+Tree path, while a wide range was already
close to the full scan. This is why selection is costed rather than automatic.
No min/max, histogram, MCV, floating selectivity guess, or persistent statistics
change is involved. One-sided and Text/Bool ranges remain SeqScan; index
union/intersection, join alternatives, and sort avoidance remain deferred.

Phase 7C evaluates each join predicate through a non-owning view over the
already materialized left and right child rows. A rejected pair allocates no
combined value vector and copies no row values; a matching pair is materialized
normally in left-then-right order. Controlled before/after full-profile runs at
500×500 and 1,000×1,000 show the strongest improvement for fully disjoint joins,
while unique-like and duplicate-key joins also benefit from avoiding work on
their rejected pairs. This is only a constant-factor executor optimization:
candidate-pair growth remains quadratic, PhysicalPlan still contains only
NestedLoopJoin for joins, and there is no join reordering, cost model, or new
join algorithm.

## CI and compatibility

`cargo check --workspace --all-targets` compiles the benchmark, including on
the Rust 1.85 MSRV. The expensive workload is not a normal CI performance gate
and has no pass/fail timing threshold.

Phase 7B changed the current Inspection JSON contract from v1 to v2 to expose
the new physical operator. Phase 7C keeps Inspection JSON v2 and changes no
NetbaDB Protocol v1 message, SDK Schema Spec v1 field, deployment manifest v4
field, or database persistent format.
