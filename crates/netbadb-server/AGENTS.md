# Server session rules

- The server depends on `netbadb-core` and the language-neutral protocol; core
  and lower layers MUST NOT depend on the server.
- `SessionState` owns the protocol transaction lifecycle. Failed commit or
  rollback attempts MUST retain retryable transaction handles, and disconnect
  handling MUST explicitly resolve or report an active transaction.
- Session and database execution remain synchronous. Future async networking
  MUST stay outside the synchronous database core.
- Wire responses MUST expose stable protocol domain values and errors, never
  internal Rust layouts, discriminants, debug strings, pages, or row locators.
